# IAM as a service

INFN provides IAM as a service to partner research communities. In this
scenario, a dedicated IAM instance is deployed on the INFN infrastructure and
configured according to the community needs. 

INFN takes care of keeping the service operational and up-to-date, while
administrative control on the IAM instance is granted to the community. 

The following IAM deployments are examples of IAM deployed as a service for
partner communities:

- [DODAS](https://dodas-iam.cloud.cnaf.infn.it): The Dynamic On-Demand Analysis
  Service (DODAS) allows to instantiate on-demand container-based clusters.
  Both HTCondor batch systems, and platforms for Big Data analysis based for
  example on Spark or Hadoop, can be deployed on any cloud-based
  infrastructures with almost zero effort.

- [eXtreme Datacloud project](https://iam.extreme-datacloud.eu/): The eXtreme
  DataCloud project (XDC) project aims at developing scalable technologies for
  federating storage resources and managing data in highly distributed
  computing environments, as required by the most demanding, data intensive
  research experiments in Europe and worldwide.
