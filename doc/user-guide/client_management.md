## OAuth roles and why they matter

When approaching OAuth people are often confused by the terminology: what is a
client? Isn't the client the user? What's the different between a client and a
protected resource? What's the difference between OAuth and OpenID-connect?

Since there are many great resources online that explain these concepts very
well, we include here a couple of pointers that are useful to clarify this kind
of doubts:

- [Introduction to OAuth2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2)
- [OpenID-connect explained](http://connect2id.com/learn/openid-connect)

## IAM Client management
