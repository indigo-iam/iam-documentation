# Linking an external account

A user can link an external account from the IAM dashboard (i.e., the user must
be logged in the IAM service). The following sets of screenshots show the
process followed to link a Google account.

Clicking on the "Link Google account" opens a confirmation dialog:

When the user clicks on the __Link__, button is redirected to Google for
authentication:

After a succesfull authentication the user is redirected to the IAM page, and a
confirmation dialog shows that the account was linked succesfully:

Now the user can logout from the IAM and login using the __Sign in with
Google__ button.

A similar process is implemented for SAML external accounts.
