All the actions described below require administrator privileges.

## Creating a user account

A new user account in the organization can be created from the "Users"
management panel by clicking on the "Add user" button at the bottom of the

deleted:

## Disabling a user account

User accounts can be disabled from the user home page by clicking on the
"Disable user" button. Disabled users are not allowed to login in the IAM and,
as such, cannot authenticate at any services that rely on the IAM for
authentication and authorization.
