# User Guide

This is the IAM user guide. This guide is targeted at IAM service users, i.e.
those who use the IAM as an authentication and authorization service for their
application.

IAM currently supports two types of users:

- __Normal users__: these users can login with the IAM, register client applications
  that use the IAM for authentication, link external accounts to their account
  (when allowed by the configuration)
- __Administrators__: these are users that have also administration
  privileges for an IAM organization (i.e. can manage groups, create users,
  etc.)
