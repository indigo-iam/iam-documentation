# Changing the account password

Once logged in you can change your account password by clicking on the "Change password" button
in your home page:

Note that the "Change password" functionality is only useful if you remember
your IAM account password. In case you forgot it, logout from the IAM and
follow the instructions in the [Reset account password][reset-password]
section.
