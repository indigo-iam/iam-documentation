# Group Management

IAM provides a group management system, that can be used by IAM administrators
to create groups, remove existing ones and manage membership in the group.

Groups can be organized in a hierarchical structure, with the following constraints:
 - a group can have only a parent group;
 - a group can have many childrens.

# Manage groups using the web interface

The simplest way to manage groups is using the IAM dashboard.

## Creating a group

From the home page, open the _Groups_ section and click the _Add group_ button:

To create a group, specify a group name. If the created group is a subgroup of
an already existing group, the parent group can be selected via a dialog.

Note that IAM allows for multiple root level groups.

A new children group can also be created from the parent group details page.

## Deleting a group

From the groups list page, click on the corresponding _Remove_ button.
A confirmation window will be opened, so you can confirm or abort the
the delete operation.

**Only empty groups can be removed. If you try to remove a group
with a child group or with user members, the operation fails with an error.**

## Managing membership for a group


To add a user to a group open the user details page.
In the _Groups_ section, click on the _Add to group_ button:

![INDIGO IAM Add group to user button](images/IAM-groups-06.png)

Choose one or more groups and confirm the operation:

When a user is added as member of a group, he/she does not inherit the
membership in the parent group, i.e. the user must be explicitly associated
with all the groups.

To remove a user from a group, click the _Remove_ button.

Members can also be removed from the group details page, as shown in the
following screenshot:
